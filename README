Introduction
TVants is a P2PTV application written and designed by Zhejiang University.
Most programs on TVants are provided and shared by users, so the availability of a program depends on its popularity.
Users can add their media source to the platform, or even set up their own media cast platform -- because it can act 
both as a client and a server.
This project is a Python client for accessing the channels in TVants network.

Requirements
1. Python 2.5.2 or higher
2. Python Modules - asyncore, socket, psyco, binascii, struct, time, threading, sys, collections, hashlib, random, optparse,
    curses, locale, sys, itertools, itemgetter, attrgetter, SocketServer, re
3. Video player for ASF streams, e.g. VLC, MPlayer.

Usage
1. cd to tvants/scripts
2. Running tvants.py without arguments will start the text-based interface and connect to the TVAnts tracker to get the
    channel list
3. Select the desired channel and press 'c' to connect
4. Wait for video buffer to fill(100 chunks or more should usually be enough) before trying to play stream.
5. Start watching with your favorite video player, e.g.
    a) mplayer http://localhost:1688/1
    b) vlc http://localhost:1688/1

Interface commands

1. General commands
<tab> - switch between "Top Channels" and "Neighbours" panes
<F5> - update channel list from tracker
q - quit program
+ - increase minimum neighbours
- - decrease minimum neighbours

2. "Top Channels" commands
<UP>, <Down> keys - move to desired channel
c - connect to selected channel when in "Top Channels"

3. "Neigbours" commands
<UP>, <Down> keys - move to desired neighbour
<DEL> - disconnect neighbour

Commandline Options
-v VIDEOPORT, --videoport=VIDEOPORT. TCP port (default 1688) used for http stream
-p PEERPORT, --peerport=PEERPORT. TCP port (default 16800) used to communicate with peers
-t TRACKERPORT, --trackerport=TRACKERPORT. TCP port (default 13800) used to communicate with tracker
-u URI, --uri=URI, TVAnts URI, e.g. tvants://list.tvants.com/tvants/?k=d5f061678caf14562047f8b3717d8be7

Video URI
http://localhost[:VIDEOPORT]/[Buffer Position]
Buffer Postion - position at video buffer to start playing from. Valid values: 1 to 238

Known Problems
1. Some channels have not been successfully decoded
2. Resizing terminal window can cause program's UI to fail
