TVants is a P2PTV application written and designed by Zhejiang University.
Most programs on TVants are provided and shared by users, so the availability of a program depends on its popularity.
Users can add their media source to the platform, or even set up their own media cast platform -- because it can act 
both as a client and a server.

This project is a Python client for accessing the channels in TVants network.
